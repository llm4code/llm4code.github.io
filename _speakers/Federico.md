title: "Building the Hybrid Human-AI Developer: From Code Completion to Agents"
abstract: "AI has rapidly transformed the developer landscape, moving from experimental code completion features to indispensable tools integrated into modern IDEs. The impact is undeniable, with significant portions of code now being generated with AI assistance, accelerating development workflows worldwide. <br><br>The progress doesnâ€™t stop at code completion. The next frontier is the development of sophisticated AI agents within the IDE, capable of more complex tasks and deeper collaboration. These agents are intelligent systems designed to understand context, perform multi-step actions, and interact collaboratively with the developer. Building these hybrid human-AI systems presents unique challenges: designing intuitive UX, building auxiliary models, and steering the agent towards effective collaboration with the user. <br><br>In this talk, Federico will discuss the evolution of AI copilots within IDEs, from the initial release of GitHub Copilot to the emerging paradigm of AI agents in Cursor. We will explore the critical aspects of building successful hybrid human-AI development environments, sharing insights and lessons learned on tackling the technical challenges involved in creating the next generation of intelligent developer tools."
