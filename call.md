## 1. Paper Types and Formats

This workshop accepts research papers, position papers, and extended abstracts:

* **Research papers (4 ‚Äì 8 pages including references)** on novel approaches, tools, datasets, or studies.  
* **Position papers (1 ‚Äì 4 pages including references)** on novel ideas and positions that have yet to be fully developed.  
* **Extended abstracts (1 ‚Äì 5 pages including references)** that are free of article processing charges.

**Important Note on Publication Charges:** All ACM papers, excluding "extended abstracts" (up to five pages), are subject to ACM Open Access policies. ACM papers, excluding "extended abstracts", require either an Open Access institutional agreement or article processing charges (APCs) paid by the authors (USD 250 for ACM members, USD 350 for non-members) for publication.

All papers must be in English, in PDF format, and must not exceed the page limits listed above. Papers should be submitted via [HotCRP](https://icse2026-llm4code.hotcrp.com/) and will be reviewed in a double-blind process.

Submissions should use the official "ACM Primary Article Template", which can be obtained from the [ACM Proceedings Template page](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). LaTeX users should use the `sigconf` option and the `review` option (to produce line numbers for easy reference by reviewers). The following LaTeX code should be placed at the start of the document:

```latex
\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}
```

Detailed submission policies and formatting guidelines are aligned with the [ICSE 2026 Research Track submission process](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-research-track#submission-process).

## 2. Archival vs. Non-Archival

All accepted papers by default will appear in the ICSE 2026 workshop proceedings (i.e., the **archival** option). The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by **ACM**. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2026. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.  

We also provide a **non-archival** option on the paper submission system (HotCRP) for authors who prefer not to have their papers in the proceedings. For non-archival papers, the camera-ready version will only be posted on our workshop website (and will not be listed on DBLP). 

Please note that regardless of which option you choose (archival or non-archival), submissions must be fully **original** work (not accepted or published elsewhere) at the time of submission, and at least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop and present the paper.

## 3. Best Paper Awards

**üèÜ We will announce best paper awards (up to 10% of accepted papers) during the workshop!**
